# Rule: Tests Required for Rules Changes

Any change to deterministic logic under `src/rules/` must include tests:
- add or update unit tests for changed behavior,
- keep fixtures aligned with expected outputs,
- verify the full test command passes.

No rule-engine changes should merge without test coverage.
