# Rule: No Hardcoded Assignment Fields in UI

UI forms must render sections and fields from `schema/assignment.schema.json`.

Prohibited:
- hardcoding assignment field IDs in page components to build forms,
- embedding static section structures that diverge from schema.

Allowed:
- generic field renderers by type,
- reusable UI controls that receive schema field definitions as props.
